Core Track Project (8th Jan)
Vault Lite – File-Based Credential Manager
This is a learning-focused, simplified version of Vault OS to introduce File I/O + structured
logic.

Build a simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game where:
The user chooses a move
The computer move is predefined
The winner is decided using if / elif / else
This task focuses on decision-making using conditionals.

2.Use a predefined computer move: ‘computer_move = "rock"’
[Optionally generate random move]
3.Compare the user’s move with the computer’s move and print:

"You Lose"
"It's a Draw"
